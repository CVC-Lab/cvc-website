The main objective of this paper is to\r\n   synthesize sound from 3D time-varying multivariable field data with\r\n   distributed \"turbulent\" spots. Our technique takes a hybrid approach\r\n   between parameter mapping and direct simulation. During preprocessing,\r\n   acoustic strengths are computed at each spatial points at each time\r\n   step. During interaction, users navigate within the volume space and\r\n   audio frames are computed by integrating the acoustic radiations from\r\n   the sound sources. A number of problems inherent in auralization and\r\n   our solutions are discussed.","RegisterDate":"10/17/2012 9:33","Authors":"Y. Shin, C.

Bajaj, V. Pascucci, R. Holt, A. Netravali \r\nFourth issue in the special series of Discrete Applied Mathematics on Computational Molecular Biology, 2001 \r\nMolecular surface computations are basic molecular modeling operations that are necessary in order to perform synthetic drug design. Computing and updating exact boundary representations of such molecular surfaces are critical steps that introduce for molecules the same geometric data structure used in the solid modeling community. In this paper we introduce efficient techniques for computing NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) boundary representations of molecular surfaces, providing also the option of trading accuracy of the representations for the efficiency of the computations, especially in a dynamic setting. In particular we discuss two main classes of updates: one that keeps the topology of the molecular configuration fixed, and the more complicated case where the topology may be updated continuously","RegisterDate":"7/10/2012 17:32","Authors":"C.

The extracted\r\ntetrahedral and hexahedral meshes are extensively used in the\r\nFinite Element Method (FEM). A top-down octree subdivision coupled\r\nwith the dual contouring method is used to rapidly extract\r\nadaptive 3D finite element meshes with correct topology from\r\nvolumetric imaging data. The edge contraction and smoothing method\r\nis used to improve the quality of the extracted meshes.

In designing our compression method, we have compromised between two important goals: high compression ratio and fast random access ability, and have tried to minimize the overhead caused during run-time reconstruction. Our compression technique is suitable for applications wherein data are accessed in a somewhat unpredictable fashion, and real-time performance of decompression is necessary. The experimental results on three different kinds of 3D images, medical imaging, image-based rendering, and solid texture mapping suggest the compression method can be used effectively in developing real-time applications that must handle large volume data, made of color samples taken in three- or higher-dimensional space","RegisterDate":"7/11/2012 16:46","Authors":"C.

We explicitly characterize curve families whose members have the required interpolating properties and possess a minimal number of inflection points. The regular algebraic spline curves considered here have many attractive features: They are easy to construct. There exist convenient geometric control handles to locally modify the shape of the curve. The error of the approximation is controllable. Since the spline curve is always inside the parallelogram, the error of the fit is bounded by the size of the parallelogram. The spline curve can be rapidly displayed, even though the algebraic curve segments are implicitly defined.","RegisterDate":"7/12/2012 10:38","Authors":"C. Bajaj, G.

The rational trivariate function provides increased degrees of freedom so that the number of surface patches needed for free-form shape modeling is significantly reduced compared to earlier similar approaches. Furthermore, the surface patches have quadratic precision, that is, they exactly recover quadratic surfaces.

On the other hand, 3D texture mapping generates highly natural visual effects in which objects appear carved from lumps of materials rather than laminated with thin sheets as in 2D texture mapping. Storing 3D texture images in a table for fast mapping computations, instead of evaluating procedures on the fly, however, has been considered impractical due to the extremely high memory requirement. In this paper, we present a new effective method for 3D texture mapping designed for real-time rendering of polygonal models. Our scheme attempts to resolve the potential texture memory problem by compressing 3D textures using a wavelet-based encoding method. The experimental results on various non-trivial 3D textures and polygonal models show that high compression rates are achieved with few visual artifacts in the rendered images and a small impact on rendering time. The simplicity of our compression-based scheme will make it easy to implement practical 3D texture mapping in software/hardware rendering systems including the real-time 3D graphics APIs like OpenGL and Direct3D.","RegisterDate":"7/11/2012 17:13","Authors":"C.

Considering parameterizations in terms of rational functions that have real \r\ncoefficients and vary over real parameter values, we show how to replace one global \r\nparameterization with a finite number of alternate bounded parameterizations, each defined \r\nover a fixed, bounded part of the real parameter domain space. The new bounded parameterizations \r\ntogether generate all real points of the old one and in particular the points corresponding to \r\ninfinite parameter values in the old domain. We term such an alternate finite set of bounded \r\nparameterizations a finite representation of a real parametric curve or surface. Two solutions \r\nare presented for real parametric varieties of arbitrary dimension n. In the first method, a \r\nreal parametric variety of dimension n is finitely represented in a piecewise fashion by 2n \r\nbounded parameterizations with individual pieces meeting with C?‡ continuity; each bounded \r\nparameterization is a map from a unit simplex of the real parameter domain space. In the second \r\nmethod, only a single bounded parameterization is used; it is a map from the unit hypersphere \r\ncentered at the origin of the real parameter domain space. Both methods start with an \r\narbitrary real parameterization of a real parametric variety and apply projective domain \r\ntransformations of different types to yield the new bounded parameterizations. Both these methods \r\nare implementable in a straightforward fashion. Applications of these results include displaying \r\nentire real parametric curves and surfaces (except those real points generated by complex \r\nparameter values), computing normal parameterizations of curves and surfaces \r\n(settling an open problem for quadric surfaces).","RegisterDate":"12/4/2006 14:02","Authors":"C.

This is often true in geometric \r\ndesign, where only smooth segments or patches are considered over a well-chosen polynomial basis. \r\nVisualizing an arbitrary and possibly discontinuous parametric surface is useful but \r\nnon-trivial for algebraic surfaces defined by rational parameter functions. Such surfaces have \r\npole curves in their domain, where the denominators of the parameter functions vanish, \r\ndomain base points that correspond to entire curves on the surface, and other features that \r\ncause display algorithms to fail. These are ubiquitous problems occurring even among the \r\nnatural quadrics. Sophisticated but unsuspecting display techniques (e.g. those implemented in \r\nMaple V, Mathmatica) produce completely unintelligible results. We provide a general \r\nsolution and discuss our implementation. First, projective domain transformations are applied \r\nthat map the entire surface from a finite domain region. Then, domain pole curves are identified \r\nand numerically approximated. Using Delaunay triangulation, a special decomposition of the \r\ndomain is constructed that avoids discontinuities. This is then mapped onto the \r\nsurface and clipped against a 3D box. The implementation can display very complicated \r\nsurfaces, as we shall illustrate. Our techniques generalize in a straightforward way to rational \r\nvarieties of any dimension.","RegisterDate":"2/8/2007 11:20","Authors":"C. Bajaj, A.

In visualizing these turbulent <br> fluids, an appropriate incorporation of their<br> incandescent properties into the rendering<br> significantly enhances the realism of visual<br> effects. In this paper, we effectively <br> synthesize the light emission phenomena of <br> hot gaseous fluids by extending the photon<br> mapping global illumination method. In<br> particular, we add two new photon maps to<br> capture the thermal radiation effects. First,<br> we define an emission photon map to store the<br> photons emitted within hot gaseous fluids.<br> Second, we utilize additionalflash and flash<br> reflection photon maps, which are effective<br> in creating a visual effect of light that<br> intensively and instantly propagates outside<br> hot gaseous fluids, visually capturing shock<br> waves. Our current technique, while based on<br> the theory of blackbody radiation, is<br> parameterized to enable an animator to <br> generate a wide range of visual effects with<br> fairly intuitive user control. We demonstrate<br> the effectiveness of our new rendering <br> technique and user-controlled generation of<br> visual effects with several example pictures<br> and animations.","RegisterDate":"12/4/2006 14:02","Authors":"B.

Particles are smooth functions over\r\ncircular or spherical domains. The algorithm first breaks the bounded region containing the particles into Voronoi\r\ncells that are then subsequently decomposed into an initial quadrilateral or an initial hexahedral sca®old conforming\r\nto individual particles. The sca®olds are subsequently refined via applications of recursive subdivision (splitting\r\nand averaging rules). Our choice of averaging rules yield a particle conforming quadrilateral/ hexahedral mesh, of\r\ngood quality, along with being smooth and di®erentiable in the limit. Extensions of the basic scheme to dynamic\r\nre-meshing in the case of addition, deletion, and moving particles are also discussed.

However, these uniform sampling methods still possess high time complexity, and \r\nin particular, are highly memory intensive for predicting large protein-protein docking sites. \r\nBy taking advantage of an irregularly and adaptively sampled, smooth particle \r\nrepresentation of molecular shape, in combination with the use of irregularly spaced FFT \r\ntransforms, we eliminate an explicit uniform grid.

The proposed approach is simple and is easy to incorporate into any uniform timestep diffusion implementation with significant improvements over evolution results with the uniform timesteps. As an additional alternative to the adaptive discretization in the time direction, we also provide an approach for the choice of an adaptive diffusion tensor in the diffusion equation.","RegisterDate":"7/10/2012 16:15","Authors":"C.

Electron Microscopy (EM) and in\r\nparticular single particle reconstruction using cryo-EM, has rapidly\r\nadvanced over recent years, such that several complexes can be\r\nresolved routinely at low resolution (10-20A) and in some cases at\r\nsub-nanometer (intermediate) resolution (7-10A). These complexes\r\nprovide not only insights into protein and nucleic acid folds, but\r\nperhaps even more importantly provide information about how the\r\nvarious structural components interact. There are increasing numbers\r\nof molecules where the tertiary or secondary structure of a complex\r\ncan be fully determined using EM. Often the crystal structures of\r\nindividual domains or components of these complexes are also known. An\r\nemerging trend in these fields is to fit the atomic resolution X-ray\r\ncrystal structures into the cryo-EM map, to provide a quasi-atomic\r\nresolution model of the overall complex, possibly revealing details\r\nabout molecular interactions within the assembly. In addition, with\r\nthe increasing capability of determining multiple functional\r\nconformers of a complex, there is the promise of studying the dynamics\r\nof such interacting systems. The large physical size and complexity of\r\nsuch complexes combined with intermediate to low resolution models,\r\npresents challenges for structure to biological function\r\ndetermination. This chapter reviews some of the crucial three\r\ndimensional geometric post-processing once a volumetric cryo-EM map\r\n(henceforth a 3D Map) has been reconstructed, as essential steps\r\ntowards an enhanced and automated computational structure\r\ndetermination pipeline. In particular the paper addresses 3D Map\r\nfiltering, automated structural feature determination, and the\r\ndevelopment of quasi-atomic models from the reconstructed 3D Map.","RegisterDate":"12/14/2015 17:49","Authors":"C.

For both these algorithms, we employ the tools from computational geometry and differential topology, specifically the computation of stable/unstable manifolds of certain critical points of the distance function induced by the molecular surface. With the results in this paper, we thus draw a connection between the mathematically well-defined concepts with the bio-chemical structural folds of proteins.","RegisterDate":"5/7/2010 11:33","Authors":"C.
