Our team is developing next-generation Predictive Intelligent Networking (PIN) agents—AI-driven solutions designed to optimize communication in dynamic, adversarial networks. This is a unique chance to work on cutting-edge research that blends game theory, machine learning, and stochastic processes, with real-world applications in predictive modeling and network scalability.\n\nWe're accepting applications now and welcome students from diverse backgrounds, including Mathematics, Physics, Computational Science, and Computer Science. Whether you're exploring a future Ph.D., seeking a meaningful side project, or eager to dive into innovative AI research, we'd love to hear from you!\n\n**What You'll Do:**\n- Contribute to the development and training of AI-based PIN agents.\n- Explore optimization strategies for dynamic communication networks.\n- Work alongside a talented team under the guidance of Prof. Chandrajit Bajaj and Lead Research Scientist Ryan Farell.\n\n**Who We're Looking For:**\n- Enthusiastic students with an interest in AI, game theory, or stochastic processes.\n- Bonus points if you have experience with computational modeling or risk minimization—though a willingness to learn is what matters most!\n\n**Details:**\n- **Duration:** Summer 2025\n- **Compensation:** Paid position\n- **Location:** University of Texas at Austin\n\n**How to Apply:**\nPlease send your resume and a brief note about your interest in the project to both:\n- Ryan Farell: ryan.farell@utexas.edu\n- Chandrajit Bajaj: bajaj@oden.utexas.edu\n\nApplications are open now, and we can't wait to meet our next team member! Join us in shaping the future of intelligent networking.\n\n---\n\n![drone-swarm.jpg](../images/projects/dynamic_belief_games/drone-swarm.jpg)\n*Figure: A visual of our DBG gym, demonstrating a drone swarm scenario.*\n\n![dynamic_belief_games_diagram.png](../../images/projects/dynamic_belief_games/dynamic_belief_games_diagram.png)\n*Figure: The main diagram explaining Dynamic Belief Games.*\n\n![ts-predictions.jpg](../../../images/projects/dynamic_belief_games/ts-predictions.jpg)\n*Figure: This image shows time series prediction – we generate distributions over future communication demands.*\n\n![integrated_network_v4.png](../../../../images/projects/dynamic_belief_games/integrated_network_v4.png)\n*Figure (Soldier's Network): An example of our expanded MANET overlay, illustrating how Predictive Intelligent Networking (PIN) Agents (e.g., NetTop and Observability Agents) interface with heterogeneous Army radio networks.
