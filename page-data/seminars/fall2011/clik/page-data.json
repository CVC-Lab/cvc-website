Many commodity PCs provide high performance multi-threading environment including multi-core CPUs and programmable GPUs. In this talk, I will explain an idea to parallelize our octree-based approximation method for molecular energetics and force calculations using cilk++ and CUDA with efficient multi-thread programming. I will begin with a brief review of the cilk++ and CUDA programming model. After explaining the octree-based approximation algorithm, I will talk about how to parallelize it and some optimization issues. We will conclude with some experimental results for selected molecular energetics and force computations.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Parallelizing molecular energy and force calculations using cilk++ and CUDA"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5f1caf75-db1e-5b56-b62a-a5b7b4f56275","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/fall2011/clik","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
