Compared to the prokaryotic ribosome, the eukaryotic ribosome is much larger and contains more complex RNA and proteins. This last decade has witnessed the progress of revealing eukaryotic ribosome structure by the cooperation of X-ray and cryo-EM technologies. In this talk, we will present the current status of ribosomal protein modeling for Trypanosoma Brucei from a high resolution EM density map. From the protein sequences, we will show the pipeline of homology modeling and models evaluation. Then partial results on flexible fitting of the protein models into the density map, segmentation and secondary structures detection for each protein will be reported. Challenges and problems will be addressed for further research. This is a collaborative research project with the J. Frank group.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ribosomal Protein Modeling for Trypanosoma Brucei from a 5.16A EM Density Map"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"012bb454-807f-5fe9-bc81-5e1a84aa528f","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/fall2011/ribosomal-protein","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4166265360"],"slicesMap":{}}
