An optimal separating polyhedron among all K has the fewest possible facets. Finding an optimal separator in 2D can be done in O(nlogn) time. Finding an optimal separator in 3D has been shown to be NP-hard. Approximation algorithms exist, but only for convex P and Q. I will present a new algorithm that works on arbitrary P and Q and has similar performance guarantees (in terms of facet complexity) to the algorithms restricted to the convex case.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Polyhedron Separation"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f6cb4b90-c1b7-5624-ad6c-1734eb230dc9","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/fall2011/polyhedron","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
