Some previous approaches only rely on empirical statistics, positive examples or average negative examples. We formulate a learning framework for deriving parameters for scoring function based on observed binding modes. A QP based optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the distance between correct and incorrect configurations. Experiments are conducted on scoring function in F2Dock but this framework can handle a much richer class of interaction modes (the only constraint is the scoring function should be a weighted summation of multiple energy terms).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Learning Parameters in F2Dock"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8d0ac2cb-a744-5180-ac03-502120a8d0b6","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/fall2011/learning-parameters","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
