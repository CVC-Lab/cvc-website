In this talk, we present a reduced flexibility model for efficient exploration of relevant conformational space, allowing us to avoid exhaustive searches of all degrees of freedom while docking. An algorithm for detecting potential sites of flexibility using a knowledge-based approach is presented.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Reduced Flexibility Model for Macromolecules"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8d2c941f-d2b0-596c-be2d-d3f3d6c5a2fd","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/fall2011/macromolecules","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
