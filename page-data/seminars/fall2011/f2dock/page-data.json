In the first part of the talk, we discuss all of these and explain the (mostly manual) strategy applied to train them. In the second part of the talk we explore several existing techniques for automated training of different types of parameters and evaluate their feasibility in training the parameters of F2Dock.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Training F2Dock"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c953b752-a369-5e2f-8a12-d02e310d91f1","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/fall2011/f2dock","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
