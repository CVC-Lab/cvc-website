Though there are tens of proteins—and hundreds of accompanying interfaces— which are known to undergo shear, little is known about the shearing mechanism itself. Do a given pair of protein interfaces undergo shear? If so, to what degree? These questions are currently difficult to answer.</p>\n<p>My talk will be in two parts. In the first part, I will present a simple, planar shear parametrization; apply it to several helix-helix interfaces in citrate-synthase, comparing my results with those in the literature; and draw a few preliminary inferences. In the second part, I will present the results of applying shear to a docking exercise involving the SIV-17b complex and the D1D2 neutralizing antibody.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Understanding Shear in Proteins"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"01ebdb69-14a8-5c64-ac39-b8c88810ff9c","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/fall2011/shear","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
