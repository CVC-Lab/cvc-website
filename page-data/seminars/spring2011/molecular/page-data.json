This problem is important in many fields, especially in the implicit solvation model which is widely used in molecular dynamics, protein interactions, docking, fitting, etc. First, we summarize the known results focusing on the Gaussian molecular model and alpha shape theory. Later we question whether it is possible to use only one molecular surface model for all our computations, i.e., surface, area, volume and their derivatives. Related nonpolarized energy (force) calculations used in softwares such as Amber and Gromacs will be reviewed. The challenges before us and some heuristic ideas are provided for discussion.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Molecular Surfaces: Area, Volume, and Atomic Derivatives"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c0d7be8b-c08d-5ea9-9e3e-613492b2d423","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/spring2011/molecular","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
