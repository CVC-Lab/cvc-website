I will present a number of criteria that a model should meet before being used in analysis. I will also discuss various approaches to the reconstruction problem, their strengths and weaknesses and our extensions to get the reconstructions closer to being ready for analysis. I will conclude by discussing our initial forays into bounding the error of our models, which is the final major criterion that appears not to have been addressed in the literature.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Analysis-ready 3D reconstructions of complex objects from planar cross-sectional slices"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8b05cca1-580e-5c34-b020-3ab0da3310d7","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/spring2011/reconstructions","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
