Due to the very large set of parameters which need to be explored, lead optimization is often described as the tightest bottleneck in the drug discovery process.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we briefly summarize prior work in lead optimization and then go on to propose (1) an iterative algorithm for solving this multi-parameter optimization problem of simultaneous chemical modification and structural refinement, (2) a reduced flexibility model for the efficient modeling of large proteins’ relevant degrees of freedom, and (3) an improved and “tunable” scoring function.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Lead Optimization in Computational Drug Design: An Iterative Approach to Structural and Chemical Refinement"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"11b0c0fd-6dc3-5949-8a08-0939d855797e","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/spring2011/drug-design","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4166265360"],"slicesMap":{}}
