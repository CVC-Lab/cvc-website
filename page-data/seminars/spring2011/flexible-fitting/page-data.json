All flexible fitting algorithms ask, and answer, three questions: 1)\nHow can P be deformed? 2) How can P be correlated with M? and, 3) How can\ndeformation and correlation be a) sped up and b) made more accurate? Whereas\napproaches to flexible fitting in the past have answered questions 1 and 2 fairly\nwell, 3 has been essentially ignored; for instance, most flexible fitting\napproaches do not quantify either the complexity of their technique or the loss in\naccuracy due to its application on the PDB. In addition, the question of\ncorrelating the PDB with the density map has been answered in nearly identical ways:\nby blurring the PDB and computing its spatial correlation with the density map.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we present a new answer, based on motion assignment to domains, to\nquestion 1; a new answer, based on skeletonization of density maps, to question 2;\nand a new answer, based on rotational and translational FFT speedups, to question 3.\nWe thus present a new flexible fitting algorithm, highlighting the ways in which it\nis different from older, more tested approaches. We also outline the reasons why we\nexpect it to work.</p>\n<p>Notes: The above title and abstract belong to my proposal talk, which I hope to give\nin May. Wednesdayâ€™s talk, while featuring most of the techniques promised above,\nwill not be complete. In particular, it will discuss issues of speed but ignore for\nthe time being those of accuracy; it will contain rather more technical detail than\na proposal talk can, or should, tolerate; it will have a low to middling number of\npictures; and it will introduce the audience to concepts with which they are already\nfamiliar. (The reason for the last is actually quite important: my proposal\ncommittee is made largely of professors of mechanical engineering, who do <em>not</em> know\nabout PDBs and alpha helices and Gaussian blurring. )</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Flexible fitting of subunit assemblies into cryo-EM density maps"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a4418e8d-2c0a-554d-9501-ae697fdd9ec2","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/spring2011/flexible-fitting","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
