We motivate things by examining the particular geometric elliptic system forming the constraints in the Einstein equations, and summarize some basic results about solutions. We then develop a weak-* convergence framework for abstract approximation algorithms for nonlinear operator equations. We next introduce some additional conditions that allow for building a contraction framework. We then indicate how both convergence frameworks can be used to recover a number of existing convergence and optimality results for adaptive finite element methods for linear and nonlinear elliptic problems on open sets in Rn, as well as establish some new results for geometric elliptic PDE problems on Riemannian manifolds. Time-permitting, we outline a new analysis of surface finite element methods for problems such as the Einstein constraints, by first analyzing variational crimes in Hilbert complexes, and then applying the results to finite element exterior calculus on hypersurfaces.</p>\n<p>Parts of this work are joint work with Gabriel Nagy, Gantumur Tsogtgerel, Yunrong Zhu, Ari Stern, and Ryan Szypowski [1-4].</p>\n<p>[1] M.
