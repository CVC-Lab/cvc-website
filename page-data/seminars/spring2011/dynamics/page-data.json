Hence in field of molecular dynamics, one of the computationally intensive processes, GPUs have been highly exploited in the past decade. In this talk, I will give you a brief introduction of CUDA architecture including major features for optimization, and summary of previous researches for GPU-based MD simulation.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Survey of GPU-accelerated Molecular Dynamics"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b5a26b15-520e-5010-a639-d4ad155c1ca1","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/spring2011/dynamics","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
