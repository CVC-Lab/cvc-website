First, a\nvariational formulation of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation will be used to derive expressions for atomic forces needed for certain protein simulations. These forces are adapted to a model using point charges and a discontinuous dielectric function. Also, the model is extended to include an ion exclusion layer which is treated both theoretically and computationally.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Closer Look at the Poisson-Boltzmann Model"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"34010756-3b64-5792-b99c-79eb65c25b23","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/spring2011/poisson-boltzmann","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4166265360"],"slicesMap":{}}
