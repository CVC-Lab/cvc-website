More than half of these complexes consist of more than\n2 proteins and hence predicting such complex/assembly falls beyond the scope\nof traditional pairwise docking techniques. The goal of this talk is to\nreview the current state of the art in multi protein docking and to identify\nunsolved problems. We shall discuss, compare and critique the existing\nmulti-protein docking algorithms. For each of these algorithms we identify\nthe classes of oligomers that can be predicted by the algorithm, the\nunderlying docking principle, how the algorithm deals with the combinatorics\nof the multi-protein complex, and how the method was tested/validated.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Multi protein docking"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"02368d27-eeae-5a1b-8068-1b0992e71fa8","frontmatter__slug":"/seminars/spring2011/multi-protein-docking","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"seminars"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
