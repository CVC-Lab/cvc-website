While these methods continue to enjoy tremendous success, predicting complex materials properties remains incredibly time-consuming even as we approach exascale computing. The main contribution of this paper is the design, training and testing of a deep learning framework based on a generative variational auto-encoder (for ab initio materials design) using FAIR principles.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Semi-Supervised Variational Inference for Generative Materials Design"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7076224d-744d-5313-ab26-3df2be0a0a5f","frontmatter__slug":"/projects/generative-material-design","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"projects"}}},
