The cloaking is designed using meta-materials affixed to the shape or even with control over the shape itself, while the source/sensor can be from any direction relative to the object. We hope to continue our work on this project, building off the groundwork that will be discussed in this report.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Inverse Generative Modeling for Stealth and Cloaking Devices using Meta-materials"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"58953926-0f26-5c1f-bef8-4ea678add1f1","frontmatter__slug":"/projects/shape-optimization","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"projects"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2105308271"],"slicesMap":{}}
