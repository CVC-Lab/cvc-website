Second row: zoomed-in view of mesh quality and a cut view of the consistent multi-domain mesh.</p>\n<p>A point cloud is generated from a preliminary mesh representing the boundary between different domains from the discrete volumetric representation used as input.</p>\n<p>A higher-order level-set method is  employed to produce a quality sub-mesh from this point cloud and geometric flow is used as smoothing mechanism.</p>\n<p>An approach is developed to detect and curate intersections within an assembly of these 2-manifold sub-meshes by utilizing the intermediate volumetric representation. The separation between sub-meshes can be controlled by the user using a gap threshold parameter.</p>\n<p>The resulting  high quality multi-domain mesh is free from self- and inter-domain intersections and can be further utilized in finite element and boundary element computations.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<p>Q.
