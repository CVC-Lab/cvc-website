Note: Our previous multi-domain meshing software can be found <a href=\"http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bajaj/cvc/software/MMM.shtml\">here</a>. <img src=\"http://cvcweb.ices.utexas.edu/images/qmdm-braina.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"qmdm-braina\"> <img src=\"http://cvcweb.ices.utexas.edu/images/qmdm-brainb.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"qmdm-brainb\"><img src=\"http://cvcweb.ices.utexas.edu/images/qmdm-brainc.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"qmdm-brainb\"> First row: original brain data and the resulting multi-domain mesh. Second row: zoomed-in view of mesh quality and a cut view of the consistent multi-domain mesh. A point cloud is generated from a preliminary mesh representing the boundary between different domains from the discrete volumetric representation used as input.  A higher-order level-set method is  employed to produce a quality sub-mesh from this point cloud and geometric flow is used as smoothing mechanism. An approach is developed to detect and curate intersections within an assembly of these 2-manifold sub-meshes by utilizing the intermediate volumetric representation. The separation between sub-meshes can be controlled by the user using a gap threshold parameter. The resulting  high quality multi-domain mesh is free from self- and inter-domain intersections and can be further utilized in finite element and boundary element computations. <strong>References</strong> Q.
