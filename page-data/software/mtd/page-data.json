A simple message server was created to emulate MPI's broadcast command using tcp/ip.</p>\n<p>See the source for an example <a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bajaj/cs395T02/molecular/astro/server.py\">server</a> and an example <a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bajaj/cs395T02/molecular/astro/in_client.py\">client</a></p>\n<h3>What the code does</h3>\n<p>Using the python message passing discussed above, python was embedded into SGI's perfly code. As a first iteration in this experiment, only the mouse structure was passed between machines. This ensures that any interaction with perfly on the server host will be mirrored in all the different perfly programs running on the displays. The same technique could be applied to the Chromium system to achieve communication between the host and the displays.</p>\n<p>Due to time constraints, the data decomposition has not been parallelized. Thus each display node must have enough memory to load up the entire data set in these first attempts.</p>\n<p>The source code changes consist of the following:</p>\n<p>in common/main.C: embed the python message passing to communicate the mouse structure</p>\n<p>in common/generic.C: change PreFrame() so that the client perfly version will not listen to mouse events</p>\n<p>And that's it!</p>\n<p>Modifications can be found <a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bajaj/cs395T02/molecular/astro/common.tar.gz\">here</a></p>\n<p>The modifications only occur in the \"common\" directory, so only that is included.</p>\n<h3>What is the input/output?</h3>\n<p>The code will read any format that the standard perfly distribution will read.</p>\n<p>As long as the entire data set is placed on each rendering node, the data can be visualized and interacted with on an arbitrary number of screens, regardless of the operating system of the rendering node.</p>\n<h3>What are the lessons learned</h3>\n<p>The principle lesson learned is the difficulty finding a system that adequated resolves the multi-tiled display problems. Even promising programs such as Chromium ( formerly WireGL ) are not quite up to addressing the challenges of using a complicated browser across platforms for multi-tiled displays.</p>\n<p>The second lesson learned is the relative simplicity with which communication across platforms can be accomplished using Python to achieve multi-tiled display interactivity.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"MTD"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4322add6-38e0-55c0-a067-b1943d37be0c","frontmatter__slug":"/software/mtd","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"software"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["4166265360"],"slicesMap":{}}
