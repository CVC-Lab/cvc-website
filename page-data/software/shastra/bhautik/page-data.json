BHAUTIK provides the tools necessary to set up and perform scientific and engineering simulations on geometric models. Problems can be two or three dimensional, using objects created in VAIDAK, SHILP, or other model creation toolkits. BHAUTIK has several finite element mesh generation options, including good bounded aspect ratio triangulations.</p>\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Finite Engine Mesh of a Jet Engine Â  Meshes can be subdivided repeatedly to gain more accuracy in analysis and visualization. A material database is maintained which contains both structural and heat properties of various materials. Boundary conditions including external forces, fixed nodes, and external heat sources can be specified interactively.</li>\n<li>Boundary forces on a tetrahedral mesh. Results obtained from interfacing to finite element solvers are displayed for the user.</li>\n<li>Stress analysis of a femural implant</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Download</h3>\n<p>Version 1 of BHAUTIK is available from anonymous FTP at ftp.cs.purdue.edu in the file /pub/.php/bhautik-sun.tar.Z</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Bhautik Physical Analysis Toolkit"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"471852c7-9739-505f-92dd-d1be0a4e5240","frontmatter__slug":"/software/shastra/bhautik","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"software"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1689586968"],"slicesMap":{}}
