_PFCorr, a polar Fourier correlation library, have been implemented in order to perform an efficient computation for a set of correlations required by our rigid-body/flexible fitting libraries. The PFCorr can also be exploited for other applications that need to evaluate correlation on the nonequispaced sample domain._

### Features

- Supported operations

- Computing SDF coefficients
- Computing correlation between a pair of scalar-valued functions sampled on a grid
