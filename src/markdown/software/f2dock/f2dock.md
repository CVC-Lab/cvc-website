_F2Dock, a rigid-body protein-protein docking software, have been implemented in a client-server framework. The [client](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7Ebajaj/cvc/software/f2dockclient.shtml) is a part of the [_TexMol_](../texmol) package. For a description of the algorithm, brief overview of the performance and a list of corresponding publications, refer to the Protein-protein docking [_project_](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7Ebajaj/cvc/projects/angstrom/sd/dock.shtml) page._

### Features

*   Supported operations
    *   Protein-protein docking
    *   Reranking docking results
    *   Protonation and partial charge assignment using PDB2PQR
    *   Molecular surface generation using Molsulf
    *   Separation (or addition) of skin atoms of proteins
    *   Integration point sampling on the surface for energetics computaions
