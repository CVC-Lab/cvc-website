The goal of the Shastra research project is providing a substrate of geometric data structures and algorithms which allow the distributed construction and modification of a synthetic environment, efficient querying of objects attributes, collaborative interaction with the environment, fast computation of collision detection and visibility information for efficient dynamic simulation and real-time scene display. In particular, we address the following issues:

### Geometric and Graphics Support

A _geometric framework_ for modeling and visualizing synthetic environments and interacting with them. Some of the problems we are investigating are:

- Space Decomposition & Search Structures
  - Regular Triangulations & History DAGS
  - Octree Deompositions & Binary Search Trees
  - Convex Decompositions & Partitioning Search Trees
- Model Construction
  - A-patch smoothing
  - Smooth reconstruction from unorganized points
  - Reconstruction from Slices
  - Volume Modelling
- Toolkits
  - Ganith
  - Shilp
  - ISMA
- Collision Detection
- Interrogative Visualization

### Distribution and Collaboration Support

A _distribution_ and _collaboration_ substrate that supports construction, modification and interaction with synthetic environments on networked desktop machines.

- Distribution Support
  - Kernels
  - Object communication
- Collaboration Support
  - Session Management
  - Floor Control
  - Access Regulation
  - Constraint Management

### Synthetic Environments

Some of the applications areas for which we are building Synthetic Environments are:

- Air/Land/Sea Defense
- Human Body Walkthrough
- Molecular World
- Networked Learning Spaces
- Economic Visualization
