### Bones:Â 

Source Data: CT scan  
242 slices (0.8mm of separation) each of 512 by 512 samples regularly distributed on a total areal of 204mm by 204mm.

Each slice is contoured and the resulting contours are stacked together to determine the solid bone model.

The model must then be segmented so that each bone can be described as an independent structure.

### Tendons

Source Data: MRI scan  
67 slices (3mm of separation) each of 256 by 256 samples regularly distributed on a total area of 120mm by 120mm

The tendons are obtained as isocontours at isovalue 42 resulting in a model of both skin and tendon.

The tendons then need to be seperated from the skin.

(Partial extraction of the Flexor Digitorum Profundus)

### Remaining Work

- Complete extraction of tendon data from the tendon and hand model.
- Combine tendon model with bone model for a complete geometric model.
