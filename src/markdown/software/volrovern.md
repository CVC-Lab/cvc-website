### Description

_VolRoverN_ is a software package that offers comprehensive functionality for geometric and electrophysiological neuronal simulation at multiple scales. It produces spatially realistic surface models of neuronal processes, glia, and intracellular organelles from cross-sectional traces. This results in a "forest" of structures. These surface meshes are geometrically accurate and topologically correct. Beyond visualization and a suite of direct geometric quantifications, _VolRoverN_ generates derivative models for sophisticated simulations at multiple scales, such as cable and electrodiffusion models. Functionality includes:

*   3D reconstruction of neurons from RECONSTRUCT series files
*   2D and 3D geometry curation and improvement
*   Extra-cellular space (ECS) generation
*   Cable model export to NEURON
*   Electrodiffusion model export to MCell (both surface mesh and tetrahedra)

_VolRoverN_ is an integral part of our Neuromodeling project. It shares components with [VolumeRover2](../volumerover) and thus has many shared features.
