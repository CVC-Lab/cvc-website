### Description

_SSEP_ is a secondary structure elucidation package for intermediate resolution (5-10 Angstrom) cryo ElectroMicroscopy (EM) data. This package right now includes two approaches to elucidate helices and sheets and it will include another approach which is under development. These two approaches are nominated as

*   Volume based approach
*   Surface based approach
