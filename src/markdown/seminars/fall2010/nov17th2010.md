Abstract:
A rotation-minimizing adapted frame (RMF) $(f_1,f_2,f_3)$ on a given space curve $r$ is characterized by the fact that the frame vector $f_1$ coincides with the tangent $\frac{r’}{\|r’\|}$, while the frame angular velocity $\omega$ maintains a zero component along it. Its minimal twist makes RMFs be widely used in computer graphics . This includes sweep of blending surface modeling, motion design and control in computer animation and robotics, streamline visualization, and tool path planning in CAD/CAM. After introducing basic definitions, I will present a method to construct low degree rational curves with RMFs.This method is based on the use of rational spatial Pythagorean-Hodograph curves (rational curves with rational hodograph) and some classical results from Geometry of Curves and Surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$.
