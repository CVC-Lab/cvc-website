Multi protein docking

More than 80% of the proteins in living cells are found either as symmetric
oligomers formed by copies of same protein, or as heterogeneous complexes
with other proteins. More than half of these complexes consist of more than
2 proteins and hence predicting such complex/assembly falls beyond the scope
of traditional pairwise docking techniques. The goal of this talk is to
review the current state of the art in multi protein docking and to identify
unsolved problems. We shall discuss, compare and critique the existing
multi-protein docking algorithms. For each of these algorithms we identify
the classes of oligomers that can be predicted by the algorithm, the
underlying docking principle, how the algorithm deals with the combinatorics
of the multi-protein complex, and how the method was tested/validated.
