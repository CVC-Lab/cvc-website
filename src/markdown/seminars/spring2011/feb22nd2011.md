Statistical regularization method for electron tomography reconstruction

Previously, I had presented a statistical regularization method for ET reconstruction and an optimization scheme using Conjugate Gradient. Continuing on the same theme, I will discuss a method for performing regularization using a segmentation step and comparing with a spatial prior. I will also focus on some preliminary analysis of methods for evaluating reconstruction volumes.
