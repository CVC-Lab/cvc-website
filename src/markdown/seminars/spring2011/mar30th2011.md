Survey of GPU-accelerated Molecular Dynamics

The parallel computing environments in computer graphics have been improved rapidly especially on modern graphics hardwares(GPUs). Hence in field of molecular dynamics, one of the computationally intensive processes, GPUs have been highly exploited in the past decade. In this talk, I will give you a brief introduction of CUDA architecture including major features for optimization, and summary of previous researches for GPU-based MD simulation.
