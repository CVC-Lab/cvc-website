Our labâ€™s seminar series kicked off Friday at 11am where new and old students alike were able to introduce themselves and their research interests. After the mingling, Prof. Bajaj kicked off our lecture series with a talk on Multivariate Gaussian Processes and Noisy Regression.

Our Fall Seminar Series will be held every Friday at 10:30am-noon. These meetings are currently held over zoom, but we will be shifting back to in-person meetings starting September 17th. All of our meetings will be recorded for those who are not able to attend
