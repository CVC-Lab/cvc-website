Prof. Bajaj gave a talk titled Probabilistic Inference for Fast Learning in Optimal Control at our second seminar series held via zoom on September 10th. This was a continuation of last weekâ€™s talk titled Multivariate Gaussian Processes and Noisy Regression. Several lab members are working on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), and these talks were given in part to break down the challenges and approaches currently taken to solve these problems.

Our Fall Seminar Series is held every Fridays from 10:30am-noon. These meetings are currently held over zoom with recordings available to those not able to attend.
