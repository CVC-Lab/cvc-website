Some newer binaries were posted not long ago for Mac OSX, Windows and Linux. Also, automatic twitter updates from svn commits broke earlier this summer but are now working again. [Check it out!](/software/volumerover) Note, if the commit message is longer than ~134 characters, it will be silently ignored and not posted to twitter. Will be fixed soon!
