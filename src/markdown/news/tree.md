The IEEE Computer Society Bangalore Chapter planted _A Bountiful Tree_ for Prof. Bajaj at Trees for Tigers, Panna Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, India. The trees planted in this project create employment for local communities; provide an abundance of fruit, flowers, fodder, and fuel to rural communities, their livestock, and endemic wildlife; improve water catchment, reduce soil erosion and benefit generations to come by sequestering carbon and improving the air quality.
