The capstone project in Professor Bajajâ€™s Geometic (Bio) Modeling and Visualization course involves using the CVC-created software F2Dock to computationally dock protein complexes.  With a set of known protein complexes, the students will train the algorithms scoring or filtering parameters and then apply the most successful parameter combinations to unknown challenge complexes.  Students will present their results of their docking experiments at noon on Dec. 6th.
