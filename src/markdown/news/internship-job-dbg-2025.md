### Summer 2025 Internship Opportunity – Predictive Intelligent Networking (PIN) Project

We are excited to announce a paid internship opportunity for Summer 2025 with the Dynamic Belief Games (DBG) project at the University of Texas at Austin! Our team is developing next-generation Predictive Intelligent Networking (PIN) agents—AI-driven solutions designed to optimize communication in dynamic, adversarial networks. This is a unique chance to work on cutting-edge research that blends game theory, machine learning, and stochastic processes, with real-world applications in predictive modeling and network scalability.

We're accepting applications now and welcome students from diverse backgrounds, including Mathematics, Physics, Computational Science, and Computer Science. Whether you're exploring a future Ph.D., seeking a meaningful side project, or eager to dive into innovative AI research, we'd love to hear from you!

**What You'll Do:**
- Contribute to the development and training of AI-based PIN agents.
- Explore optimization strategies for dynamic communication networks.
- Work alongside a talented team under the guidance of Prof. Chandrajit Bajaj and Lead Research Scientist Ryan Farell.

**Who We're Looking For:**
- Enthusiastic students with an interest in AI, game theory, or stochastic processes.
- Bonus points if you have experience with computational modeling or risk minimization—though a willingness to learn is what matters most!

**Details:**
- **Duration:** Summer 2025  
- **Compensation:** Paid position  
- **Location:** University of Texas at Austin  

**How to Apply:**
Please send your resume and a brief note about your interest in the project to both:  
- Ryan Farell: ryan.farell@utexas.edu  
- Chandrajit Bajaj: bajaj@oden.utexas.edu  

Applications are open now, and we can't wait to meet our next team member! Join us in shaping the future of intelligent networking.
