## Inverse Generative Modeling for Stealth and Cloaking Devices using Meta-materials

The project sets out to optimally design functions using inverse Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF) that, via control of shape or material properties, can cloak the object with respect to acoustic waves and a given sensor. The cloaking is designed using meta-materials affixed to the shape or even with control over the shape itself, while the source/sensor can be from any direction relative to the object. We hope to continue our work on this project, building off the groundwork that will be discussed in this report.
