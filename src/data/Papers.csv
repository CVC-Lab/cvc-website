Abstract:
In this paper we present an automatic algorithm to segment the
asymmetric subunits of an icosahedral density map. This approach
is readily applicable to the structural analysis of a broad range
of macromolecular structures that are reconstructed using the
cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) technique. Our algorithm
includes three major steps: the detection of critical points, the
detection of icosahedral symmetry axes, and the segmentation of
asymmetric subunits. The experiments on the real molecular density
maps reconstructed by cryoEM technique as well as the synthetic
maps calculated from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) demonstrate the
high-quality performance of our approach.","2006-12-04 15:09:13","800",NULL,"(with Z. Yu)"

Molecular surface computations are basic molecular modeling operations that are necessary in order to perform synthetic drug design. Computing and updating exact boundary representations of such molecular surfaces are critical steps that introduce for molecules the same geometric data structure used in the solid modeling community. In this paper we introduce efficient techniques for computing NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) boundary representations of molecular surfaces, providing also the option of trading accuracy of the representations for the efficiency of the computations, especially in a dynamic setting. In particular we discuss two main classes of updates: one that keeps the topology of the molecular configuration fixed, and the more complicated case where the topology may be updated continuously","2012-07-10 17:32:37","1000",NULL,"(with V.

Adaptive and Quality 3D Meshing from Imaging Data

This paper presents an algorithm to extract adaptive and quality
3D meshes directly from volumetric imaging data. The extracted
tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes are extensively used in the
Finite Element Method (FEM). A top-down octree subdivision coupled
with the dual contouring method is used to rapidly extract
adaptive 3D finite element meshes with correct topology from
volumetric imaging data. The edge contraction and smoothing method
is used to improve the quality of the extracted meshes. The main
contribution is extending the dual contouring method to crack-free
interval volume 3D meshing with feature sensitive adaptation.
Compared to other tetrahedral extraction methods from imaging
data, our method generates high quality adaptive 3D meshes without
introducing any hanging nodes. Our algorithm has already been
applied successfully to constructing the geometric model of the
molecule (mAChE) in solving the diffusion problem using FEM.","2006-12-04 15:09:13","900",NULL,"(with Y. Zhang, B. Sohn)"

This paper presents a new 3D RGB image compression scheme designed for interactive real-time applications. In designing our compression method, we have compromised between two important goals: high compression ratio and fast random access ability, and have tried to minimize the overhead caused during run-time reconstruction. Our compression technique is suitable for applications wherein data are accessed in a somewhat unpredictable fashion, and real-time performance of decompression is necessary. The experimental results on three different kinds of 3D images, medical imaging, image-based rendering, and solid texture mapping suggest the compression method can be used effectively in developing real-time applications that must handle large volume data, made of color samples taken in three- or higher-dimensional space","2012-07-11 16:46:10","1000",NULL,"(with I.

In this paper (part three of the trilogy) we use low degree G1 and G2 continuous regular algebraic spline curves defined within parallelograms, to interpolate an ordered set of data points in the plane. We explicitly characterize curve families whose members have the required interpolating properties and possess a minimal number of inflection points. The regular algebraic spline curves considered here have many attractive features: They are easy to construct. There exist convenient geometric control handles to locally modify the shape of the curve. The error of the approximation is controllable. Since the spline curve is always inside the parallelogram, the error of the fit is bounded by the size of the parallelogram. The spline curve can be rapidly displayed, even though the algebraic curve segments are implicitly defined.","2012-07-12 10:38:39","1000",NULL,"(with G. Xu)"

We approximate a manifold triangulation in IR3 using smooth implicit algebraic surface patches, which we call A-patches. Here each A-patch is a real iso-contour of a trivariate rational function defined within a tetrahedron. The rational trivariate function provides increased degrees of freedom so that the number of surface patches needed for free-form shape modeling is significantly reduced compared to earlier similar approaches. Furthermore, the surface patches have quadratic precision, that is, they exactly recover quadratic surfaces. We give conditions under which the C1 smooth and single sheeted surface patch is isolated from the multiple sheets.","2012-07-12 10:37:19","1000",NULL,"(with G. Xu, H. Huang)"

On the other hand, 3D texture mapping generates highly natural visual effects in which objects appear carved from lumps of materials rather than laminated with thin sheets as in 2D texture mapping. Storing 3D texture images in a table for fast mapping computations, instead of evaluating procedures on the fly, however, has been considered impractical due to the extremely high memory requirement. In this paper, we present a new effective method for 3D texture mapping designed for real-time rendering of polygonal models. Our scheme attempts to resolve the potential texture memory problem by compressing 3D textures using a wavelet-based encoding method. The experimental results on various non-trivial 3D textures and polygonal models show that high compression rates are achieved with few visual artifacts in the rendered images and a small impact on rendering time. The simplicity of our compression-based scheme will make it easy to implement practical 3D texture mapping in software/hardware rendering systems including the real-time 3D graphics APIs like OpenGL and Direct3D.","2012-07-11 17:13:39","1000",NULL,"(with I.

parameter domains. Considering parameterizations in terms of rational functions that have real 
coefficients and vary over real parameter values, we show how to replace one global 
parameterization with a finite number of alternate bounded parameterizations, each defined 
over a fixed, bounded part of the real parameter domain space. The new bounded parameterizations 
together generate all real points of the old one and in particular the points corresponding to 
infinite parameter values in the old domain. We term such an alternate finite set of bounded 
parameterizations a finite representation of a real parametric curve or surface. Two solutions 
are presented for real parametric varieties of arbitrary dimension n. In the first method, a 
real parametric variety of dimension n is finitely represented in a piecewise fashion by 2n 
bounded parameterizations with individual pieces meeting with C?‡ continuity; each bounded 
parameterization is a map from a unit simplex of the real parameter domain space. In the second 
method, only a single bounded parameterization is used; it is a map from the unit hypersphere 
centered at the origin of the real parameter domain space. Both methods start with an 
arbitrary real parameterization of a real parametric variety and apply projective domain 
transformations of different types to yield the new bounded parameterizations. Both these methods 
are implementable in a straightforward fashion. Applications of these results include displaying 
entire real parametric curves and surfaces (except those real points generated by complex 
parameter values), computing normal parameterizations of curves and surfaces 
(settling an open problem for quadric surfaces).","2006-12-04 14:02:44","1000",NULL,"(with A. Royappa)"

by which a piecewise-linear approximation is generated. This is often true in geometric 
design, where only smooth segments or patches are considered over a well-chosen polynomial basis. 
Visualizing an arbitrary and possibly discontinuous parametric surface is useful but 
non-trivial for algebraic surfaces defined by rational parameter functions. Such surfaces have 
pole curves in their domain, where the denominators of the parameter functions vanish, 
domain base points that correspond to entire curves on the surface, and other features that 
cause display algorithms to fail. These are ubiquitous problems occurring even among the 
natural quadrics. Sophisticated but unsuspecting display techniques (e.g. those implemented in 
Maple V, Mathmatica) produce completely unintelligible results. We provide a general 
solution and discuss our implementation. First, projective domain transformations are applied 
that map the entire surface from a finite domain region. Then, domain pole curves are identified 
and numerically approximated. Using Delaunay triangulation, a special decomposition of the 
domain is constructed that avoids discontinuities. This is then mapped onto the 
surface and clipped against a 3D box. The implementation can display very complicated 
surfaces, as we shall illustrate. Our techniques generalize in a straightforward way to rational

that the classic Weber problem, along with the line-restricted Weber problem and its three-

direct consequence of these results is that for these geometric optimization problems there 
exists no exact algorithm under models of computation where the root of an algebraic 
equation is obtained using arithmetic operations and the extraction of k-th roots. This leaves 
only numerical or symbolic approximations to the solutions, where the complexity of the

In visualizing these turbulent <br> fluids, an appropriate incorporation of their<br> incandescent properties into the rendering<br> significantly enhances the realism of visual<br> effects. In this paper, we effectively <br> synthesize the light emission phenomena of <br> hot gaseous fluids by extending the photon<br> mapping global illumination method. In<br> particular, we add two new photon maps to<br> capture the thermal radiation effects. First,<br> we define an emission photon map to store the<br> photons emitted within hot gaseous fluids.<br> Second, we utilize additionalflash and flash<br> reflection photon maps, which are effective<br> in creating a visual effect of light that<br> intensively and instantly propagates outside<br> hot gaseous fluids, visually capturing shock<br> waves. Our current technique, while based on<br> the theory of blackbody radiation, is<br> parameterized to enable an animator to <br> generate a wide range of visual effects with<br> fairly intuitive user control. We demonstrate<br> the effectiveness of our new rendering <br> technique and user-controlled generation of<br> visual effects with several example pictures<br> and animations.","2006-12-04 14:02:44","900",NULL,"(with B.

systems within a bounded region in two and three dimensions, respectively. Particles are smooth functions over
circular or spherical domains. The algorithm first breaks the bounded region containing the particles into Voronoi
cells that are then subsequently decomposed into an initial quadrilateral or an initial hexahedral sca®old conforming
to individual particles. The sca®olds are subsequently refined via applications of recursive subdivision (splitting
and averaging rules). Our choice of averaging rules yield a particle conforming quadrilateral/ hexahedral mesh, of
good quality, along with being smooth and di®erentiable in the limit. Extensions of the basic scheme to dynamic
re-meshing in the case of addition, deletion, and moving particles are also discussed. Motivating applications of the
use of these static and dynamic meshes for particle systems include the mechanics of epoxy/glass composite materials,
bio-molecular force field calculations, and gas hydrodynamics simulations in cosmology","2006-10-05 15:17:56","900",NULL,NULL

grid based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approaches have been shown to produce by far the 
fastest, correlation profiles of complex protein-protein interactions over the six dimensional 
search space. However, these uniform sampling methods still possess high time complexity, and 
in particular, are highly memory intensive for predicting large protein-protein docking sites. 
By taking advantage of an irregularly and adaptively sampled, smooth particle 
representation of molecular shape, in combination with the use of irregularly spaced FFT 
transforms, we eliminate an explicit uniform grid. We are able to produce efficiently, highly

In this chapter, we solve a diffusion partial differential equation numerically for noise removal of arbitrary triangular manifolds using an adaptive time discretization. The proposed approach is simple and is easy to incorporate into any uniform timestep diffusion implementation with significant improvements over evolution results with the uniform timesteps. As an additional alternative to the adaptive discretization in the time direction, we also provide an approach for the choice of an adaptive diffusion tensor in the diffusion equation.","2012-07-10 16:15:42","1000",NULL,"(with G.

molecular structures (henceforth, complexes), utilizing cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM), electron tomography (ET), X-ray crystallography
(X-ray) or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), need to be
ably complemented with faster and more accurate computational and
geometric processing for ultrastructure elucidation at the best level
of resolution that is possible. Electron Microscopy (EM) and in
particular single particle reconstruction using cryo-EM, has rapidly
advanced over recent years, such that several complexes can be
resolved routinely at low resolution (10-20A) and in some cases at
sub-nanometer (intermediate) resolution (7-10A). These complexes
provide not only insights into protein and nucleic acid folds, but
perhaps even more importantly provide information about how the
various structural components interact. There are increasing numbers
of molecules where the tertiary or secondary structure of a complex
can be fully determined using EM. Often the crystal structures of
individual domains or components of these complexes are also known. An
emerging trend in these fields is to fit the atomic resolution X-ray
crystal structures into the cryo-EM map, to provide a quasi-atomic
resolution model of the overall complex, possibly revealing details
about molecular interactions within the assembly. In addition, with
the increasing capability of determining multiple functional
conformers of a complex, there is the promise of studying the dynamics
of such interacting systems. The large physical size and complexity of
such complexes combined with intermediate to low resolution models,
presents challenges for structure to biological function
determination. This chapter reviews some of the crucial three
dimensional geometric post-processing once a volumetric cryo-EM map
(henceforth a 3D Map) has been reconstructed, as essential steps
towards an enhanced and automated computational structure
determination pipeline. In particular the paper addresses 3D Map
filtering, automated structural feature determination, and the
development of quasi-atomic models from the reconstructed 3D Map.","2015-12-14 17:49:25","950",NULL,"(with Z. Yu)"

Additionally, we show that when the resolution is coarser than $10 angstroms, some of the tertiary structural motifs can be detected from 3D EM. For both these algorithms, we employ the tools from computational geometry and differential topology, specifically the computation of stable/unstable manifolds of certain critical points of the distance function induced by the molecular surface.

Our method first constructs a triangular prism scaffold covering the PDB structure, and then generates a piecewise polynomial F on the Bernstein-Bezier (BB) basis within the scaffold. An ASMS model of the molecular surface is extracted
as the zero contours of F which is nearly C 1 and has dual implicit and parametric representations.  The dual representations allow us easily do the point sampling on the ASMS model and apply it to the accurate estimation of the integrals involved in the electrostatic solvation energy computations.  Meanwhile comparing with the trivial piecewise linear surface model, fewer number of sampling points
are needed for the ASMS, which effectively reduces the complexity of the energy estimation.","2014-06-16 09:32:43","1000",,"(with W. Zhao, G. Xu)"

Our method first constructs a triangular prism scaffold Ps covering the PDB structure, and then generates piecewise polynomial Bernstein-Bezier (BB) spline function approximation F within Ps, which are nearly C1 everywhere. Approximation error and point sampling convergence bounds are also computed. An implicit AS model of the MS which is free of singularity, is extracted as the zero contours of F. Furthermore, we generate a polynomial parametrization of the implicit MS, which allows for an efficient point sampling on the MS, and thereby simplifies the accurate estimation of integrals needed for electrostatic solvation energy calculations.","2012-07-10 18:13:36","900",,"(with W.
